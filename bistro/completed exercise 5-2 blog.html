  <h1>
   Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>
   This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Porter describes it <q>as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p>
   Next month we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>
